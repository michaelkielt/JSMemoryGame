# JSMemoryGame

Simple (pokemon-themed) game made using javascript where the user has to match two cards on the board until no more are left. 
Using this as a learning project to develop understanding of certain js methods and properties like querySelector(), 
createElement(), setAttribute(), getAttribute(), push(), setTimeout(), removeEventListener() as well as others.
